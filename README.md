# chaos-will-win
A simple 2D game made with Unity 3D.

This is the first game I ever made with Unity 3D, I used it to get to know basic Unity concepts such as GameObject and Scene, and also the first time I wrote something in C#.

It's a casual game in which the player has to *put each cat in the rectangle of the same colour* and has the chance to choose the number of colours he will be playing with.
